bootstrap 4.1.3 
to use bootstrap - npm install bootstrap and import bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css

in jsx  its not class , its className

react-router-dom 4.3.1


Class base components can tap in life cycle hooks and states where as Functional component dont have these, it stateless

//Turning class component to control component example Add project

Gonna link value in input field to its state.

name field in html form needs to match with the ones in backend
state is immutable, to change state need to set new state

When you get component rendered from route it always passes 3 props history location and match
