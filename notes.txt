bootstrap 4.1.3 
to use bootstrap - npm install bootstrap and import bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css

in jsx  its not class , its className

react-router-dom 4.3.1


Class base components can tap in life cycle hooks and states where as Functional component dont have these, it stateless

//Turning class component to control component example Add project

Gonna link value in input field to its state.

name field in html form needs to match with the ones in backend
state is immutable, to change state need to set new state

When you get component rendered from route it always passes 3 props history location and match

history paramters allows to replay

//prevents form to reload on submit
    e.preventDefault();

npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

redux 4.0.0
redux thunk 2.3.0
react-redux 5.0.7
axios 0.18

redux-thunk is used to dispatch the reducer action to redux store

to receive props from state and add to component we use lifecycle hook

for form validation styling : npm i classnames , 2.2.6

default exports are imported without {}
named exports are imported with {}

props cannot be passed from child back to parent.
Example: dashboard passes project props to child ProjectItem but not vice versa.

const {projects} = this.props.project; is equivalent to const projects = this.props.project.projects;

in spring boot , @jsonignore ensures recursion problem while creating objects. patchmapping tells server we are updating something that already exists.
one to one with project - each project will have one backlog
one to many with projectTasks - one project can have many projectTasks
refresh ensures when a projecttask which is child of bbacklog is deleted, backlog is refreshed
orphanRemoval = true is required along with CascadeType.REFRESH for delete operation
